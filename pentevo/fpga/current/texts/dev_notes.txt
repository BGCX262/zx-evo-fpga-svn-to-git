Z80 signal were a pain in the ass for me for a long time.The main thing that should be understood is that there are a delaybetween issuing Z80 clock and arrival of its signals to the inputsof the FPGA triggers. It is about 2 28MHz clock periods.The nodes that are in Z80 clock domain should latch Z80 inputs with:always @(posedge zclk) signal_in <= signal_z80;The nodes that are in FPGA clock domain should latch Z80 inputs with:always @(posedge fclk) if (zpos) signal_in <= signal_z80;
