Flow description

1.
FSM1 fills the FIFO with sound stream.
When it works, z80 is BUSRQ-ed.
It starts when FIFO is 1/2 full or less, stops when it is full,
or when number of samples per tick reaches 0.
In latter case the int and status for CPU asserted.
After CPU updated channels file, it starts the FSM1 again.


---------------------------------

FSM1
Processes channels file and samples per channel.
Reads byte from RAM (per channel).
Multiplies it by volumes and adds to adders for left/right channels.
Generates the wave stream and writes it into the buffer.
Increments addresses and processes loops.

FSM2
Outputs wave stream to DAC.

---------------------------------

FPRAM1
Channels file
(in port: Z80 / out port: FSM1)
448 (of 512), organized as 32 channels x 7 x 16bit:
        1 - control
        3 - start address
        3 - end address
        3 - loop address
        2 - increments
        2 - volume left/right
        2 - (unused)

FPRAM2
(in port: FSM1 / out port: FSM1)
Counting array
256 organized as 32 channels x 8 bytes:
        2 - sub-address
        3 - current address to read from
        1 - status of channel (stall/fwd/bck)
        2 - (unused)

FPRAM3
Wave-form buffer
(in port: FSM1 / out port: FSM2)
512 organized as 2 x 256:
    64 samples x 4 bytes:
        2 - 16 bit left
        2 - 16 bit right

---------------------------------

Steps for FSM1:
    1 - get addr for reading (reload ? FPRAM1.start address : FPRAM2.current address to read from)
    2 -
