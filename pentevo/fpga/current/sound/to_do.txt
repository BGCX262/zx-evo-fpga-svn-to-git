HUS

---------------------------------

FSM1
Processes channels table and samples per channel.
Generates list of addresses for smaples wave data reading.
Increments addresses and process loops.

FSM2
Reads samples wave data from RAM.
Fills the output DAC buffer.

FSM3
Outputs wave stream to DAC.

FPRAM1
Samples control table
(in port: Z80 / out port: FSM1)
512 organized as 32 channels x 16:
        1 - control
        3 - start address
        3 - end address
        3 - loop address
        2 - increments
        2 - volume left/right
        2 - (unused)

FPRAM2
(in port: FSM1 / out port: FSM1)
Counting array
256 oranized as 32 channels x 8 bytes:
        2 - sub-address
        3 - current address to read from
        1 - status of sample processing (stall/fwd/bck)
        2 - (unused)

FPRAM3
Addresses buffer
(in port: FSM1 / out port: FSM2)
256 is organized as 2 x 128:
    32 channels x 4 bytes:
        3 - address
        1 - sample type

FPRAM4
Wave-form buffer
(in port: FSM2 / out port: FSM3)
512 organized as 2 x 256:
    64 samples x 4 bytes:
        2 - 16 bit left
        2 - 16 bit right
